# Island of Lost Souls

Island of Lost Souls is an action-exploration and card combat game. As the player, you arrive at a remote island in search of buried treasure. What you find
instead, however, is a malicious island full of danger. It is up to you now to explore the island and rid it of its enemies. Throughout your journey, different 
enemy and boss types will be encountered. You will be able to acquire cards by looting chests and battling enemies, where each battle consists of a card game. 
The cards themselves carry the lost and captured souls that have perished before you; challenging a Boss before building up one's arsenal of cards is unwise.

*Source code is not provided in accordance with the policies of the academic course it was developed for. However, a standalone version of the game can be
downloaded under this repository's [releases](https://github.com/jrsyjueco/island-of-lost-souls/releases).*

## Gameplay Features
### Procedurally Generated World
The island is divided into four distinct biomes that change each time you enter and leave a biome. Make sure to visit each one to encounter new enemies and 
bosses. Cards can be acquired from the chests in each biome.

### Timed Maze
Running into an enemy will send you into a maze. Find your way through the maze in time to continue on your journey. Collect hearts scattered throughout the 
maze to regain your health if necessary.

### Card Battle System
When you are ready, find a boss and challenge them to a card battle. Make smart use of your inventory to come out victorious.

### Pathfinding
Move your character by clicking on the screen to set a destination point while exploring each biome.

### Saving and Loading
Game progression is automatically saved before and after encountering an enemy or boss. You can load the previously saved data by selecting `Continue` from the 
main menu.
